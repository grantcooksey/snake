## Notes
This repo is set up to work with VSCode and has multiple non-portable C/C++ configurations for different projects defined in `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`.
The path structures there depend on the arduino installation and homebrew. If either of those are upgraded or modified, those paths will probably need to be updated.

Intellisense configuration can be set with `CMD+SHIFT+P -> >C/C++: Select a Configuration...`.
